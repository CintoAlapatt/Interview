Situation:
While working on a healthcare application managing large volumes of patient data, significant performance issues were impacting healthcare providers.
Slow response times when fetching patient records, generating reports, and retrieving medical histories were negatively affecting real-time decision-making.


Task:
Identify the root cause of the performance bottleneck and systematically optimize the system to ensure rapid and efficient data retrieval.

Action:
I systematically approached the issue by:

Identifying Root Causes:

Utilized profiling tools and logging to pinpoint slow database operations.

Performed detailed SQL analysis using MySQLâ€™s EXPLAIN plan, identifying full table scans, inefficient queries, and redundant database calls.

Database Optimization:

Implemented critical indexes on essential columns, significantly reducing query execution time by 3x.

Rewrote complex nested SQL queries into optimized JOIN statements, achieving a 60% performance improvement.

Partitioned the large appointments table by year to efficiently manage growing data volume.

Caching Implementation:

Integrated Redis caching to store frequently accessed patient records, reducing database load by 40% and instantly improving response times.

Results:

Achieved 40% overall query execution time reduction.

Improved data retrieval speed by 3x through effective indexing.

Enhanced query performance by 60% using optimized JOIN operations.

Significantly reduced server load with Redis caching, enabling instantaneous data retrieval for frequently accessed information.

Enhanced system scalability for handling increased data volumes efficiently.

Impact & Lessons Learned:

Delivered timely and efficient real-time data access, significantly improving healthcare provider experience.

Demonstrated structured problem-solving skills, effectively analyzing and optimizing large-scale system performance.

Strengthened key engineering competencies in database architecture, SQL query optimization, and strategic performance tuning.
