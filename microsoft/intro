I'm a software engineer specializing in Java, backend development, AI, big data, and cloud technologies. After earning my bachelor's degree in Mechanical 
Engineering and beginning my career in the oil and gas industry, I discovered a deep passion for programming through independent projects. Driven by this 
newfound enthusiasm, I transitioned to working with a startup in the software domain and subsequently pursued a Master's in Computer Science, which expanded 
my expertise in AI, big data, analytics, and cryptography.

Currently, I'm working at Crowding, where I develop patient analytics dashboards, solving complex challenges and building high-performance applications.
My hands-on experience includes creating microservices with Spring Boot, designing RESTful APIs, and ensuring scalable, maintainable solutions. This exposure 
has honed my skills in writing clean, efficient code that directly supports business objectives.

I’m particularly excited about the MAIDAP SW2 program at Microsoft because of its unique focus on AI-driven solutions, diverse team experiences, and continuous 
learning opportunities. The idea of rotating through various teams, gaining insights into different projects, and learning from industry-leading professionals 
truly excites me. Beyond technical expertise, I pride myself on clear communication, adaptability, and a collaborative mindset, making me effective at translating 
cross-functional requirements into robust technical solutions.

Joining Microsoft’s MAIDAP SW2 program represents more than just an opportunity to write great code—it’s a chance to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, 
collaborate with dynamic teams, and accelerate my growth through exposure to varied technical challenges and mentorship. I am confident that my blend of technical 
depth, problem-solving capabilities, and enthusiasm for AI-driven technologies makes me a strong fit for this role.
