Situation:
At PaperCrane, we were developing a sports venue booking application on a pay-per-hour basis. Through conversations with customers, we identified a 
recurring issue: frequent cancellations caused primarily by individual team members dropping out at the last minute.

Task:
We needed to proactively reduce cancellations and enhance the overall user experience by addressing the root cause identified through customer feedback.

Action:
Initially, we implemented a cancellation fee to discourage last-minute cancellations. However, a high cancellation fee inadvertently led users to bypass
the app and make bookings or cancellations via offline phone calls, disrupting our digital user flow.

To resolve this issue, we introduced a feature allowing users to convert cancellations into a shared payment model, distributing the cost among confirmed
attendees. We also enabled users to create invitations for additional players to join, offering free cancellation for new invitees. Despite improving
booking retention, this approach led to some invitees not showing up, negatively impacting customer satisfaction.

Responding to customer feedback, we further refined the process by requiring invitees to make a partial upfront payment, confirming their attendance, 
and refunding the excess if fewer people attended. Additionally, we created an option for venue managers to host crowd-sourced "open games," enabling 
individuals to join existing bookings directly from the start.

Result:
These adjustments significantly reduced cancellations, improved user satisfaction, and created a robust, engaging booking experience, directly integrating
customer expectations into product development and enhancing service quality. it also led to new customer acquistion and create teams who would subsequently 
book games together.
