Situation:
I was working on a project involving backend developers, frontend developers, QA engineers, and a product manager to deliver a secure payment processing 
module that required PCI DSS compliance. We were running on a tight deadline, and every team had competing priorities.

Task:
My primary responsibility was completing the PCI DSS self-compliance form and ensuring that every team clearly understood and met the detailed requirements 
outlined in the compliance guidelines. Additionally, I had backend development tasks to complete, which further increased the complexity of the project.

Action:
I closely coordinated with each team by setting up regular compliance-focused meetings and one-on-one check-ins to discuss and verify adherence to PCI DSS
requirements. Given that compliance was initially not seen as a top priority by all teams, I proactively communicated its critical importance and 
demonstrated how neglecting compliance could significantly impact project success and security. I carefully documented all compliance checkpoints and 
communicated them clearly to prevent misunderstandings. Whenever discrepancies or potential issues arose, I actively collaborated with team members to 
quickly resolve them, ensuring comprehensive understanding and immediate remediation.

Result:
By maintaining rigorous oversight, clearly emphasizing compliance's urgency, and fostering open communication, I successfully ensured that all teams 
fully met the PCI DSS compliance requirements. This proactive and collaborative approach allowed us to submit the self-compliance form on schedule, 
significantly mitigating security risks, and strengthening overall project reliability, even under tight deadlines.
